    <p>Hey, welcome to this site about a goddess</b>!</p>



    <p>Sylvie Emma Kader</p>

    <ol>
        <li>She's made me the person I am today, She is always
        super supportive and encourages me to do the best I can at everything.</li>
        <li>She's so fucking smart, goddamn like you really have no idea, she's
        smart in every way possible, I love and admire it so much, it's inspiring.</li>
        <li>I know that this may sound corny, but literally everytime I see this woman
        she stuns me with how gorgeous she is, I hate being away from that amount of
        beauty that I am so incredably lucky to call mine. I cherish every single second
        I'm with her, the only reason I seem sad and depressed at the end of us hanging out
        is because I think about her leaving and being away from me again. Seriously I get
        so sad it's like I just saw a puppy die or something.</li>
        <li>Anyway, the point of this website is to help someone comprehend how much this human 
        being means to me, no one will ever really know what it feels like to be in a love
        as deep as this. I think about this women every moment of the day, she is always on my mind.</li>
        <li>The craziest thing is that since I love her so much, you'd probably think that we've been
        together for years, dude it's only been 8 MONTHS. FOREAL. THAT'S HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS PERSON.
        
        
        They have been the best 8 months of my entire 204 of living. I could seriously go on for hours man,
        but Sylvie is way too spectacular and marvelous to be explained in only a few sentences.
        
        
        I Would die for her, I would throw myself in front of a bus for her. I would drive across the country
        to get her a redbull. I'll do literally anything to keep her happy and stress-free, including
        getting hit in the balls</li>
