    <p>Hey, welcome to this site about a goddess</b>!</p>



    <p>Sylvie Emma Kader</p>

    <ol>
        <li>She's made me the person I am today, She is always
        super supportive and encourages me to do the best I can at everything.</li>
        <li>She's so fucking smart, goddamn like you really have no idea, she's
        smart in every way possible, I love and admire it so much, it's inspiring.</li>
        <li>I know that this may sound corny, but literally everytime I see this woman
        she stuns me with how gorgeous she is, I hate being away from that amount of
        beauty that I am so incredably lucky to call mine. I cherish every single second
        I'm with her, the only reason I seem sad and depressed at the end of us being together
        is because I think about her leaving and being away from me again. Seriously I get
        so sad it's like I just saw a puppy die or something.</li>
